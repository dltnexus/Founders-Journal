It is crucial that p99power be built on a solid foundation of first principals regardless of how long that process takes. Even the most casual observation of any social media outlet reveals an overwhelming flood of information that seems to mostly be repackaged and rehashed from other sources to the point where the origin is soon lost in the flood. I can’t see how this leads to actionable information with no solid first principals context to hook it onto.

Perception is reality and if your frame of reference is diluted by 10,000 different competing stimuli I can’t see where the mind would be capable of making meaningful decisions with truly significant impact. Stepping back and looking for a pattern in the data is useful, but for concrete actionable intelligence, p99power needs to offer a very simple, solid, core foundation in first principals. Otherwise, why should anyone really care? What lasting value could it offer those who become a part of the project? I would argue none.
