It is crucial that p99power be built on a solid foundation of first principals regardless of how long that process takes. Even the most casual observation of any social media outlet reveals an overwhelming flood of information that seems to mostly be repackaged and rehashed from other sources to the point where the origin is soon lost in the flood. I can’t see how this leads to actionable information with no solid first principals context to hook it onto.

Perception is reality and if your frame of reference is diluted by 10,000 different competing stimuli I can’t see where the mind would be capable of making meaningful decisions with truly significant impact. Stepping back and looking for a pattern in the data is useful, but for concrete actionable intelligence, p99power needs to offer a very simple, solid, core foundation in first principals. Otherwise, why should anyone really care? What lasting value could it offer those who become a part of the project? I would argue none.

Codifying these first principals into the formal whitepaper will happen in the future, but this space is for working out the first basic building blocks that will be refined in the future for review.
One of the most core principals could be described around the concept of MVP, in this case meaning Minimum Viable Person. In this context, it means to establish what is the minimum skill set that a person needs to possess in order to survive independently of all assistance from all outside forces. In other words, what mental, spiritual, emotional, physical, and financial skills are needed for a person to survive on their own if they suddenly found themselves without friends, family, or society to support them. How many of us possess or could even list what these skills might be? You cannot pour from an empty cup, so I am definitely going to have to achieve this core threshold before presuming to assist others in pursuit of the same. 

There is the oft-quoted and misquoted saying by George Bernard Shaw: “Those who can do, those who can’t teach.” http://www.searchquotes.com/quotation/Those_who_can_do%2C_those_who_can%27t_teach./4493/.  Can we agree that the overwhelming majority of rehashed and repackaged information out there is shallow? Is it not obvious that there is a lack of depth in this method? We recognize that the intention may very well be noble enough. That the authors and content creators are repackaging and rehashing this information because it does have some sort of impact at some level as they process these little gems and kick them out the door in the hopes of monetizing social interaction. But where is the heart? When do we have time to truly contemplate and imprint these bits of wisdom? What use are they if we do not write them on our soul? What lasting value can they possibly hold?
