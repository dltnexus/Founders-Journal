After watching Edward Faulkner at [Emberconf 2017] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DsBHKj90EY), it occurs to me that the Cardstack Hub will be a powerful gateway to access Git as we iterate our workflow around the Git framework. Specificallly, this means iterative versions of the .srt files updating to the branch version until you get the final revision and then merging with main branch once they are finalized. In the future, my intention would be to build out Subtitle Edit to have the option to directly save to Git. Right now I'll begin with the more manual process of saving it and then uploading the file. It seems to be a simple matter of having one additional save option that commits to GitHub directly instead of having the intermediate steps of saving and uploading.
