The purpose of this journal is to explain over time the background, purpose, and intention of the P99 Project. The hope is that it will serve as a framework and guide moving forward as the project ages and gains depth, breadth, and complexity. I can think of no better way to share it than to simply put it out there to be seen.

My life has always been a struggle. It seems that nothing has come easily, that every step has been hard fought and won only at a cost. And yet, my own journey has been a walk in the park compared to others who have indeed done so much more with their lives than I have ever even conceived of. Nevertheless, here we are. Now it's my turn to put along the path that I believe to be my destiny and life's purpose. <br><br>
The concept behind the name related to the simple mathematical operation of raising a number to an exponent of that number. In this case, we have chosen 99 as the exponent due to the significance of the number 9 and the fact that 99 is the highest number possible before rolling into a three digit exponential. I'm sure there are other singificances that will be discovered and discussed in the future, but I just like the idea of raising the base to the 99th degree.

What then is the base? People? A person? How do you raise a person to an exponential degree? Is a person just a number? No. No, a person is much more than a number, but from the elegance and simplicity of math we perhaps gain perspectives that can help us to grasp and quantify soft concepts that might otherwise elude efforts to quantify them. Even that sentence seems overly pretentious and vague. Did I mention that these musings would be the unrefined form of random thoughts swirling and colliding in a less than optimal mind? Perhaps I did. Certainly they are. Whatever the clever and elequent explanation, the gist of it is what happens when we start raising exponents on larger and larger numbers.
<br><br>
Consider the number 1 raised to the 99th power. 1 times itself 99 times is still just one. And this I believe it is with a person on their own. No matter how many exponents you raise them to, one person alone can only do so much. Thus, 1 is just 1. Now consider 2^99. 2 raised to the 99th power is 633,825,300,114,114,700,748,351,602,688. That's a pretty big number I think most would agree. And most would also agree that two people working together toward a common goal does something special that is much, much more than doubling their effort. I have heard it said that the efforts are exponentially greater, and here we have a simple mathematical congruance with that concept.

What about 3 to the 99th power? And 4? It happens that pretty soon we get to a number so large that it exceeds the estimated number of atoms in the entire known universe which one source suggests is 10^78 to 10^82. (https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/). Do you get where this is going? The exponential growth potential of people collaborating with other people is immeasurable, but just taking a poke at it gives us something we can grasp. This is the origin of People to the 99th Power and the project by that name. The idea is to rally people around common goals and objectives and exponentially multiply their efforts in the bargain. Are we inventing a new concept? Not at all, there are countless organizations all around the world doing the exact same thing in their own way. In fact, we intend to collaborate with many of them whenever common goals and objectives align. Future posts will explore more specific ideas and implementations, but this is the overall objective of the project.
